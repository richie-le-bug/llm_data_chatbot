LLM chatbot data project. 
The porpouse of this project is to develop a chatbot that is able to read, analyse and visualize data to answer some basic
questions about the given data  and recommend some suggestions.

If we get to the trainning part of the modell it would be most likely to be trained to be enviromentaly-friendly and
to avoid green-washing and other non sustainable methods.

This project will suffer some changes through time.

The current phase consists in making the modell do some basic analysis and visualise these given file (most likely a CSV).
